# To Do List App
This is a simple to do list app.
I made this project from a youtube [video](https://youtu.be/y51Cv4wnsPw?si=84CR0503a0SzkIDW)  from freecodecamp channle.

## Features

- Responsive with mobile first in mind .
- Built with accessibility (A11y) for keyboard navigation and screen readers.
- Web Storage API used to create a persistent data store so list items reappear any time we visit the web app.
